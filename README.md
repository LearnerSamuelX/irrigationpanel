# Irrigation Control Panel

The design of this web app is to use **current weather** data of neighbouring area to enhance the precipitation predication rate. 

In the summer, for those who do gardening works, occasionally they can be misled by the weather forecast. It rained just after they watered the plant or, the forecast said it was going to rain and but later on there is not a single drop. This app will enhance the predicting capability of weather forecast for irrigation works.

Predicative zone formation timeline is shown in the gif image above. The geolocation of each zone is calculated based on the **average wind direction** and the **central coordinate** of the last zone (city origin). (City ->Zone 1-> Zone 2 -> Zone 3)
