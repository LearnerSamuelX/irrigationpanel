# Irrigation Control Panel

The design of this web app is to use **current weather** data of neighbouring area to enhance the precipitation predication rate. 

In the summer, for those who do gardening works, occasionally they can be misled with the weather forecast. It rained just after they watered the plant or the forecast said it is going to rain and but there is not a single drop. This app will enhance the predicting capability of weather forecast for irrigation works.
